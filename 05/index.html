            <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst. Turing’s formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine greatly influenced the development of theoretical computer science. Today, Turing is considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>During World War II, Turing was employed at the Government Code and Cypher School housed in Bletchley Park. As a leading cryptanalyst, Turing made five major advancements in the field of cryptanalysis. One such advancement was specifying the bombe, an electromechanical device used to decipher German Enigma encrypted secret messages. Turing also wrote two papers that discussed mathematical approaches to code-breaking.</p>

            <p>In the mid-1940s, Turing moved to London and worked for the National Physical Laboratory. Turing had a leading role in the design work for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) and created an innovative blueprint for store-program computers. Although a complete working version of the ACE was never built, its concept has been modelled by technology corporations around the world for a multitude of years. The ACE influenced the design of the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15 which were some of the world’s first personal computers.</p>
            
            <p>In the late 1940s, Turing held high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and the computing laboratory at the University of Manchester. He tackled the issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" and proposed an experiment known as the “Turing Test” in order to create an intelligence design standard for the technology industry. During the past several decades, the test has majorly influenced debates and discussions over the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

> Writing semantic HTML improves communication since semantic elements provide additional information about the web page and make the web page's structure adhere to a standard. These semantic elements clarify to the browser and/or machine the meaning of a web page and its content. This understanding of the web page is also communicated to search engines and web crawlers to ensure that the right pages are delivered as results for the right queries. Moreover, web scrapers are able to extract data much more easily since the web page's structure is informative about its content. In addition, the web page will become significantly easier to update and maintain since the content and appearance of the web page can be changed easily with this type of structure.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

> Both of these layouts present the header, author, image, text content, and sources clearly. However, each layout is tailored to create a better presentation for a different     device. Version 1 would appear best on a laptop or desktop and version 2 on a smartphone.<br/><br/>

  In version 1, all the information in the blog post is presented at once without a need to scroll down to read more. This type of minimalist layout emphasizes the importance of the text content in the blog post. Although the text content takes up most of the space on the web page, the header, author, main image, and sources are still visible and readable. However, the amount of text context displayed may be overwhelming to the user.<br/><br/>

  In version 2, the presentation looks similar to a mobile view of a news website or a blog. The layout features the header, then the main image, followed by an image caption, the blog post's text content, and then the sources. The narrower width of the content and the choice of a serif font in this layout allows the text to be more readable. Moreover, the information is easily digestable since the user can scroll down the page to read more content.
